# SmartThings Apps

All these Smart Apps already exist in GitHub. They were created by brilliant people, and their names and links are at the top of each 
source file. The modifications made here are mostly cosmetic (Panel layouts, colours, Icons, playing with animations in css...) with 
integrations for other device types.

I have many 433Mhz & IR devices connected through Broadlink RM devices and am trying to get these linked through SmartThings to Alexa.... 
I already have them working direct with Alexa through RM Bridge on an Android, but missing the benefits of all being in one basket.

I am trying to give Alexa eyes (Cameras with facial recognition), ears, a nose and raising the level of responsiveness to questions.
I am also playing with screen avatars to see if she can visibly appear around the house on two or three LCD's, based on where you are.
